# Wintab; Lite-ly Rusted

This crate mostly just defines types.

They are designed to be more ergonomic to work with than those generated by
bingen if you were to work directly from `wintab.h`.

This project is intended to be used with `libloading` although as far

- Types have same layout but are more typesafe and have nicer Debug implementations
- I have borrowed a sprinkling of documentation text from Wacom's website, and
  made a few edits and adulterations of my own.

As a consequence, this approach is likely to go out of date in the future,
and be a lot of work to maintain.

For usage example please see [wintab_winit](../wintab_winit/)
